This is final exam for technical programming 2. The task that I'm were busy with here is to do a classification Model for predicting whether an individual employee is likely to withdraw funds from the accessible pot within 12 months, to help financial institutions and policymakers understand which segments  of the workforce are at the most risk of depleting their retirement savings early and allow them to implement targeted interventions. The second task was to build as model that forecasts the growth of the savings over time. Finally to document Sentiment Analysis from the Employee Feedback.
